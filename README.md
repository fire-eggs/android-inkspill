# android-inkspill
This is an InkSpill / FloodIt clone for Android.

Inspired by InkSpill.py from Chapter 10 of "Making Games with Python".

**NOTE**: Currently only tested with my 10" tablet; I don't yet have a 
development environment for emulated device testing.

#### 20170527: V0.1:
    Android Studio 3.0Pre1 / Android SDK 20
    Codebase from 'android-minesweeper' : anything left over from that
    project will eventually be removed.
    
    A bit better than "MVP" - minimum viable product. The game is
    functional, score and moves work as desired. A fade animation
    for the 'flood' stage, possibly to be tweaked. Uses canvas.
    
#### Future

+ Tweaked 'flood' animation
+ Customizable color palettes
+ New / Exit / Help buttons
+ Explore using layouts for placement
+ Handle landscape as well as portrait
+ Moves as countdown
+ Difficulty levels / board sizes
+ Remember settings / scores
+ Cleanup / organize code
+ Installer
